# Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) collections

* [CCC official website](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html#ccc)

## conventions

* apps read from stdin and output to stdout. This is true for recent years CCC, while the old CCC might read from a file.

## some problems about CCC's official docs

* the output format in some data files is not 100% correct, espcially exams before year 2008.
