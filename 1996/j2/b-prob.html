<h1>Problem B: Divisibility by 11</h1>

<p><strong>Input file:</strong> <code>div.in</code>
<br><strong>Output file:</strong> <code>div.out</code>

</p><p>Write a program which accepts as input a positive integer and
checks, using the algorithm described below, to see whether or not
the integer is divisible by 11.  This particular test for
divisibility by 11 was given in 1897 by Charles L. Dodgson
(Lewis Carroll).

</p><dl><dt>Algorithm:
</dt><dd>As long as the number being tested has more than two digits,
form a new number by:
<ul><li>deleting the units digit
</li><li>subtracting the deleted digit from the shortened number
</li></ul>
The remaining number is divisible by 11 if and only if the
original number is divisible by 11.
</dd><dt>Note:
</dt><dd>Leading zeroes are not considered part of the number and
should not be printed.
</dd></dl>

<p>As usual, the first number in the input indicates the number
of positive integers that follow.  Each positive integer has a
maximum of 50 digits.  You may assume no leading zeroes exist
in the positive integers.

</p><p>For each positive integer in the input, the output consists
of a series of numbers formed as a digit is deleted and
subtracted, followed by a message indicating whether or not the
original number is divisible by 11.  Outputs for different
positive integers are separated by blank lines.
