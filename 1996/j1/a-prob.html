<h1>Problem A: Deficient, Perfect, and Abundant</h1>

<p><strong>Input file:</strong> <code>dpa.in</code>
<br><strong>Output file:</strong> <code>dpa.out</code>

</p><p>Write a program that repeatedly reads a positive integer,
determines if the integer is <em>deficient</em>, <em>perfect</em>,
or <em>abundant</em>, and outputs the number along with its
classification.

</p><p>A positive integer, <var>n</var>, is said to be <em>perfect</em>
if the sum of its proper divisors equals the number itself.
(Proper divisors include 1 but not the number itself.)  If this
sum is less that <var>n</var>, the number is <em>deficient</em>, and if
the sum is greater than <var>n</var>, the number is <em>abundant</em>.

</p><p>The input starts with the number of integers that follow.  For
each of the following integers, your program should output the
classification, as given below.  You may assume that the input integers
are greater than 1 and less than 32500.
